    "    Protein synthesis is a complex mechanism well studied over the years (Miller 2001). A lot of those proteins that are produced by cells are excreted into the extracellular environment (Benham 2012) to allow interaction between cells in an organism (Yoshitaka Shirasaki 2014). The secretion process include endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (Stephanie J. Popa 2019) and involve proteins at the cell membrane like SNARE protein (Ferro-Novick 2013). Specific peptide sequences are recognized to control the pathway of those proteins. Those peptides are called signal peptides which are often small with a length between 15 and 30 amino acids (Benham 2012, Klatt 2012) and are removed after send to their final site (Peng Chong 2019). Signal peptides are formed by three regions: a positively charged region, a hydrophobic region and a region with the cleavage site. Secretory signal peptides are signal peptide corresponding to the secretory pathway and often situated in the N-terminal region. A change of only 2 to 4 amino acid can modify the entire pathway of the protein (Klatt 2012, Peng Chong 2019). The sequence is important to determine the pathway but also the charges (Yoshinori Tsuchiya 2003) thus, the prediction of the final location of protein is complex.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Understanding the signal peptide code has multiple uses. Knowing what protein are secreted could be useful for medical application or industrial production of protein (Peng Chong 2019). Therefore, the prediction of the peptide signal and the corresponding pathway are of great interest and developing a tool is the purpose of this work.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here, the aim is to use technique of artificial intelligence to make a statistical representation of the peptide based on referenced proteins and predict the capability of such protein to get through the membrane or to stay into the cytoplasm.  \n",

    "<!--Part why knowing is important -->\n",
    "Protein synthesis (Miller 2001) and subsequent subcellular localization involves complex mechanisms frequently studied over the years .\n",
    "Many of these synthesized proteins are excreted into the extracellular environment (Benham 2012).\n",
    "Such extracellular proteins allow cells to interact with the outside world or other cells.\n",
    "Without, multicellular organisms would be unable intercellular interactions to form tissues and body parts (Yoshitaka Shirasaki 2014).\n",
    "But also in bacterial cells there can be up to a third non-cytoplasmic proteins (Orfanoudaki 2017).\n",
    "There is a lot of interest on how to distinguish secreted from cytoplasmic proteins,\n",
    "especially for those expressing recombinant proteins.\n",
    "This is often seen in the medical sector or for the industrial production protein (Peng Chong 2019)."
